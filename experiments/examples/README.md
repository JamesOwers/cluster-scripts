# Examples

## `./simple`
Requires no packages other than python 3 and is merely illustrative.

## `./mnist`
Will allow you to test whether you're successfully using a GPU! It's based on
[this pytorch example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist).
It requires that you follow the setup in the README. This will unfortunately
take a couple of hours because it involves:
* downloading data (~30 mins)
* fully setting up your environment - a guide is available
  [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4x2Ne0lpm4KpfoIPH1_afcQVF_qoW8NWqyIIndUpow)
* and creating a conda virtual enviroment (could take up to an hour
  :upside_down_face:)

...so grab tea/coffee making paraphernalia. However, once the setup is all done
you can hopefully use this as a basis for your experiments right away.
